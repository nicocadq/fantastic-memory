# Interactive Games Repository (fantastic-memory)
Hey! This repository is dedicated to hosting a collection of fun and interactive games designed for teams of 2 to 8 people, including groups of friends, family, or coworkers. Each game is contained in its own folder, with an HTML website providing instructions and gameplay details. The games are mean to be played in person, where players can interact with different tech devices and see real time results in the application.

## Folder Structure
In order to be orginized this project will be aligned to the following folder structure:
```jsx
|-- Game 1
|   |-- Readme.md
|   |-- index.html
|-- Game 2
|   |-- Readme.md
|   |-- index.html
...
```
In the example above, you can see each game orginized in its own folder, within the game folder you will find an `index.html` and Readme file with the corresponding game's instructions and gameplay details. You could find different types of subfolders for example  `assets` folder containing images and CSS stylesheets and it will be specific to each game.
